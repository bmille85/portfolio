        <h1>Matthew Trent</h1>
        <p>Matthew Trent is a luxury jewelry boutique known for custom-designed pieces and curated ready-made collections. While the in-store experience is highly personalized and sophisticated, the website was not reflecting the same level of quality. I initiated a redesign project to create a site experience that matched the high-end brand geared towards driving conversions and customer retention.</p>

        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <p>The original website suffered from poor navigation and information hierarchy which made it hard for users to find products. It also had a cluttered product layout that overwhelmed customers instead of inspiring them. There was a lack of mobile optimization and a confusing checkout flow that led to abandoned carts and decreased purchase completion.</p>

        <p><strong>Research & Strategy:</strong> I conducted research to identify website pain points. I built personas based on the primary customer types and performed a competitive analysis of high-end jewelry sites to benchmark best practices. I created a customer journey map outlining touchpoints and decision-making behavior from homepage to purchase.</p>

        <p><strong>UX/UI Design:</strong> I developed low-fidelity wireframes for a simplified homepage with clear product categories and strong visuals. I integrated findings from SEO research to enhance product naming and search ranking performance.</p>

        <p><strong>Content & Conversion Optimization:</strong> I recommended SEO naming conventions to improve product visibility on search engines. I also reorganized product filters and category hierarchy to reduce decision fatigue. I made suggestions on improvements to the checkout process, such as clearer calls-to-action and guest checkout options.</p>

        <p>The redesign yielded a streamlined wireframe and a set of strategic UX recommendations backed by data that aligned with the brand's luxury identity and improved usability. The deliverables included a homepage and product wireframe, persona documents, SEO-optimized product naming plan, and a customer journey map to support design rationale.</p>
