        <h1>Everyday Meals</h1>
        <p>Everyday Meals is a responsive cooking tutorial and recipe site designed to make the
cooking experience more intuitive and enjoyable. Whether users are just starting out or
experienced hoe cooks, the site helps them quickly find and follow recipes with ease.
The inspiration came from observing how overwhelming most recipe sites are with
cluttered pages, ads everywhere, and poorly organized steps. I set out to solve these
frustrations by designing a visually calm, clearly structured, and responsive website
from scratch using just HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <p>The goal was to create a user-centered site that prioritizes quick, scannable access to
recipes and ingredients. Incorporates subtle interactive features like the ingredients
checklist, and works seamlessly across screen sizes.</p>
<p><strong>Research & Wireframing:</strong> I conducted an audit of top recipe sites to identify design pain
points. I then sketched low-fidelity wireframes exploring layout, structure, and recipe
flow. I developed high-fidelity mockups aligned with modern UI patterns and accessible
design principles.</p>
<p><strong>Visual Design & Branding:</strong> I iterated a custom logo to convey warmth and everyday
approachability. I created a cohesive color palette to reinforce simplicity and calmness.
I chose clean, legible typography that supports long-form reading on recipe pages.</p>
<p><strong>Development:</strong> Hand-coded the entire site using HTML and CSS with semantic structure.
I developed an interactive ingredient checklist that allows users to check off items as
they cook or shop. I designed mobile-first using media queries to ensure
responsiveness. I also optimized for accessibility by using correct heading levels, form
labeling, and focus styling.</p>
<p><strong>Testing & Iteration:</strong> I collected peer and user feedback on layout and usability. I then
simplified navigation and refined button spacing based on testing. Improved contrast,
adjusted typography scale, and made UI elements more scannable on small screens.</p>
