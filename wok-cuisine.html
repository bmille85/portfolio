        <h1>Wok Cuisine</h1>
        <p>Wok Asian Cuisine is a restaurant website developed as a front-end implementation project. This project required translating provided design wireframes into responsive, accessible, and well-structured code using only HTML and CSS. The homepage had a fixed layout, while the contact page had general content requirements but offered more creative freedom. The project emphasized clean structure, functional responsiveness, and usability.</p>

        <h3>About This Project</h3>
        <p>Many small restaurant websites suffer from poor layout structure and non-responsive forms, which can frustrate users and lead to lost business opportunities. My challenge was to faithfully translate the given visual design into code while ensuring the following: responsive behavior across devices, semantic/organized HTML structure, and usable/accessible form inputs on the contact page.</p>

        <p><strong>HTML & CSS Development:</strong> I started by translating the homepage wireframe exactly as provided, using semantic HTML tags for better accessibility. I prioritized logical document flow to support screen readers and assistive technologies. I also added subtle styling details to enhance visual hierarchy, such as form borders, heading styles, and spacing.</p>

        <p><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> I implemented media queries to ensure the layout adapts to multiple screen sizes. I ensured form fields remained legible and functional on both desktop and mobile devices. I adjusted image sizes and layout wrapping to preserve balance between text and visuals.</p>

        <p><strong>Contact Form:</strong> I created a fully functional HTML form including required fields with clear labels, email/phone radio button selector, reset and submit functionality. I also debugged layout issues related to spacing, field wrapping, and alignment during responsiveness testing.</p>

        <p><strong>Feedback & Refinement:</strong> I received peer feedback to reduce visual clutter around the form fields. I also improved the contrast and spacing for better readability. I ensured the tab-order worked logically for keyboard users.</p>

        <p>The final deliverable was a clean, functional, and responsive website that met all the parameters. Key features were pixel-accurate homepage layout based on the wireframe, custom-designed contact form with validation-ready inputs, fully responsive styling using custom CSS, and attention to detail in form usability and mobile accessibility.</p>
